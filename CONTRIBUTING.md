All contributions and ideas are very welcome.

If you want to work on the codebase, then although you don't have to, it is recommended to follow these prodedures to make collaborating with the codebase as painless as possible. 

### 1. Clone the repo

With ssh (recommended):
```bash
git clone git@github.com:big-c-note/my_ml_from_scratch.git
```

With https:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/my_ml_from_scratch.git
```
### 2. Create your branch

Depending on what you are hoping to do with your branch, you may prefix it with different subjects. Below is a suggested formula.

``` bash
#### Navigate to develop branch
git checkout develop

#### Ensure you have the latest changes
git status
git fetch origin -p
git rebase origin/develop develop

#### Create new additions.
git checkout -b feature/{issue-number}-{issue name} 

#### Create a quick fix
git checkout -b hotfix/{issue-number}-{issue-name}
```

### 3. Working on your feature branch

You should be based off of branch `develop` whether or not you make use of `git flow`. Commit your code like normal, and if there has been a day or more between your last commit, you may need to rebase your changes on top of the latest commits (head) of `develop`. 

First fetch the latest changes from all branches (and prune any deleted branches):
```bash
git fetch origin -p
```

Next ensure your local `develop` has all of the changes that the remote `develop` has.
```bash
git rebase origin/develop develop
```

Finally ensure your feature branch has all of the changes in `develop` in it.
```bash
git rebase develop feature/my-feature-branch-name-here
```

When you rebase `develop` into your feature branch, you will need to force-push it to the repo. PLEASE BE EXTRA CAREFUL with this - only use force push on a feature branch that only you have worked on, otherwise you may overwrite other peoples commits, as it will directly modify the repo's git history. 
```bash
git push origin feature/my-feature-branch-name-here --force
```

### 4. Creating a PR

Once you have wrote your cool new feature, you'll need to make a PR. If you can write any tests to support any new features introduced, this would be very welcome. If you have any conflicts with `develop` please ensure you have rebased with `develop` as instructed in step (3).

Please open a pull request via the github UI and request to merge into `develop`. Once there has been a successful review of your PR, and the automated tests pass, then feel free to merge at your leisure.
